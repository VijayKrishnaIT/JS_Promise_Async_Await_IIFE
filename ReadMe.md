# Promises()

- promises establishes the communication between producer and consumer.
- producer "generates" the promises - consumer "consumes" the promises
- promises also called as special "javascript objects"
- we will create promises by using "Promise" class constructor.
- we will consume promises by using then() - promises have following states.

1. success (resolve)

2. failure (reject)

3. pending

# Async and Await keywords

- we will consume the promise by using then()

- then() function depends on the callbacks.

- it's recommended avoid the usage of callbacks(callback hell).

- alternative solution for then() function is "async & await" keyword.
